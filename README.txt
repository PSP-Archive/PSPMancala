-------------------------------
AWARI Rules from awari.cs.vu.nl
-------------------------------

  Awari is played on a board where each player owns 6 pits.  In the initial
position, all pits are filled with four stones, thus the initial position has
48 stones. 

  The player to move chooses one of its own, nonempty pits and removes all
stones from the pit. The player then sows the stones, counterclockwise, over
the remaining pits, skipping the original pit if there are more than 11
stones to sow

  If the last stone is sown into an enemy pit that contains 2 or 3 stones
after sowing, the stones are captured. 

  In this case, if the second last pit is also an enemy pit that contains 2 or
3 stones, they are captured as well, and this process is repeated clockwise,
until the own pit, or an enemy pit containing less than 2 or more than 3
stones is reached.

  The player who captures most stones, wins the game.  The game end when a
player cannot move, however, to avoid such a situation early in the game, it
is not allowed to do a move that leaves the opponent without countermove,
unless all moves eradicate the opponent.

Mancala rules from www.compendia.co.uk
--------------------------------------

  Mancala is played on a board where each player owns 6 pits.  In the initial
position, all pits are filled with four stones, thus the initial position has
48 stones. 

  Take it in turns to sow the stones around the board, including your own store
but skipping your opponent's. If the last seed that you sow goes into the
store you get another turn.

  The store is placed on the right of each player, but it is not visible in 
PSPMancala. The content of the store is displayed in the score status line.

  If the last seed you sow ends in an empty pot on your side of the board you
capture that seed and all the stones in your opponents pot opposite. Put all
these stones in your store.

  The game ends when one player clears all the pots on their side of the board.
All the stones left on the other side of the board are now theirs to count, so
don't let the other player clear their side of the board !

  The player with the most stones in his store wins.


  Enjoy,
